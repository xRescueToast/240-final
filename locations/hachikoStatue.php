    <h1>Hachiko the Dog</h1>
    <div>
        <p>Hachiko (November 10, 1923 to March 8, 1935) was a Japanese Akita dog who is remembered for his fierce loyalty to his deceased owner, waiting over 9 years for him to return. In 1934, a statue was errected in Hachiko's honor nearby Shibuya Station, created by Teru Ando. Unfortunatly, the original statue was recycled for materials in order to help the war effort during World War Two. After the original statues recycling, the son of the original artist created a second in 1948 and still stands to this day. The head of the statue is worn smooth from the hundreds of thousands of people who have stopped to give Hachiko a pat on the head.</p>
