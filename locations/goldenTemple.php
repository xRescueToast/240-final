    <h1>Kinkaku-ji</h1>
    <div>
        <p>Kinkaku-ji, otherwise known as the Golden Pavilion, is a building of incredible cultural significance nestled in Kyoto, Japan. This Zen Buddhist temple is a perfect example of the country's rich history and architectural uniqueness. The building is adorned with gold leaf, which casts an incredible shadow into the nearby pond and stands out against the gardens of the temple. Each season brings a new perspective to this beautiful temple. The original temple was burned down by a new monk who then attempted suicide but survived and was taken into custody. He was later sentenced to seven years of prison only to be released due to symptoms of schizophrenia. These events are present in Yukio Mishima's book, The Temple of the Golden Pavilion (1956), and the ballet RAkU.</p>
