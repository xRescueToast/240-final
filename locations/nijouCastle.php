    <h1>Nijou Castle</h1>
    <div>
        <p>Nijou Castle is a building of historical significance constructed in the early 17th during the Edo period, located in Kyoto, Japan. This castle is known for its ingenious design and beautiful gardens, with its most unique aspect being its floors. The floors of Nijou Castle are dubbed "nightingale floors" because of their design, which makes the floor chirp like songbirds when walked on. The floor was made this way in as a security measure to defend against possible assasinations or intruders. The grounds of the castle reflect the grandure of the Shogunate in the Edo period and serves as a testament to Japan's feudal past.</p>
