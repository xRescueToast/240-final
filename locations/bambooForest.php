    <h1>Arashiyama Bamboo Forest</h1>
    <div>
        <p>The Arashiyama Bamboo Grive, located in Kyoto, is a natural wonder and reminds visitors of the simplistic beauty held within bamboo. As you enter the grove you are instantly surrounded on both sides by towering bomboo stalks which make it impossible to see the surounding city and creates a beautiful balacne between shadow and sunlight. Walking through the pathways in the grove you will hear the rustling of the bamboo stalks in a gentle breeze, much different from the area just outside. The Arashiyama Bamboo Grove is an excellent stop on a journy as it provides a moment of reprieve from the bustling cities of Japan.</p>
